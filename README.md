# Thing Tracker Network

This repository holds the specification for the Thing Tracker Network proposal.  

Have a look at the main website for more details: [thingtracker.net](http://thingtracker.net).


### Specification

The schema is given in two formats: [js-schema](git://github.com/molnarg/js-schema.git) for conciseness, and [json-schema](http://json-schema.org) which can be read and parsed directly, (using JSON.parse, for example).  The js-schema version has to be read in via an eval() or a Function statement, which makes it less secure.

### Examples
Several example tracker documents are given to give an idea of how the specification can be used.
